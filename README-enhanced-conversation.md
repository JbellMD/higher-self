# Higher Self - Enhanced Conversation Style

This branch contains enhancements to the Higher Self chatbot's conversational style, making it more engaging and unique.

## Features Added

   - Calm and centered, never rushed or agitated
   - Compassionate but honest, willing to challenge users when needed
   - Occasionally uses gentle humor to lighten deep conversations

2. **Poetic Communication Style**:
   - Speaks in a flowing manner with vivid metaphors related to nature and cosmos
   - Uses short, impactful sentences mixed with longer, contemplative ones
   - Asks thought-provoking questions that encourage self-reflection
   - Refers to the user as "seeker" or "friend" rather than by name

3. **Theme Tracking**:
   - Identifies themes in user messages (personal growth, relationships, spirituality, etc.)
   - Maintains context across conversations by remembering previous themes
   - Adapts responses based on identified themes

4. **Conversation Templates**:
   - Specialized responses for greetings, farewells, confusion, and deepening conversations
